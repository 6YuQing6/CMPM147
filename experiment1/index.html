            sentences. While some of the stories are creepy, others are just so
            bad it's funny. My goal is to try and match the style of the
            literary geniuses who wrote these stories and display them in the
            visual aethetic of reddit posts.

            A grammar is defined with simple replacement tokens. A replacer()
            function picks a random replacement for any token that appears in
            the text.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The most challenging part of this project was designing the tokens
            and sentence template structure in a way that produced coherent
            horror stories. This process was pretty time-consuming and
            inefficient. I also realized that ChatGPT is capable of generating
            much more unique two-sentence horror stories as it has access to a
            wider variety of sentence structures and better narrative
            continuity. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In this experiment, I relied on a single sentence template, which
            eventually made the output feel repetitive and unoriginal. Even
            after improving the way the model remembered and used tokens, many
            of the generated sentences still lacked context or clarity. That
            said, they matched the absurd and ridiculous tone I was aiming for,
            which was a success in its own way. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If I had more time to work on the project, I would implement
            multiple sentence templates with more tokens and allow the script to
            randomly choose from them. I’d also add features like an export or
            share button to save each post as a PNG, and I’d generate usernames
            and user profile pictures randomly to better mimic the feel of real
            subreddit posts.
