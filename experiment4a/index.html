          <p>
            Infinity: This project extends in all 4 directions infinitely.
            Variation in Space: There are a variety of tiles with varying colors
            and heights based on certain parameters. Variation in Key: The
            starting generation relies on a replicable world key. Signs of Life:
            The project uses Conway's Game of Life to create constant new
            generations of cells that are visually represented by height and
            color variation. The user can also interact with the generator by
            clicking to place their own living cells.

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            I utilize a combination of procedural generation algorithms to
            create a dynamically evolving virtual landscape. The core of the
            experiment lies in the unique hash value generated from user
            interactions seeds the procedural algorithms. Using the XXH32
            hashing function and p5.js's built-in noiseSeed and randomSeed
            methods, each input generates a distinct visual output on a grid of
            tiles. Each tile, depending on its hashed value, displays different
            shades and shapes, responding to clicks by altering its appearance
            and opacity. The technical architecture is designed to mimic
            infinite possibilities within a contained digital ecosystem,
            allowing each user's journey through the landscape to be unique and
            personal. The setup leverages JavaScript's flexibility and the p5.js
            library's graphical capabilities to render a responsive and
            interactive artistic piece.
