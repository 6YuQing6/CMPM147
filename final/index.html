        Created in collaboration with Lui Cui, Ben Silver, and Kevin Gallegos.

        <br />
        This project is an interactive web-based fishing game where players
        catch procedurally generated fish using p5.js. Each fish will have a
        unique appearance and a quirky, auto-generated name and description
        created with Tracery. The game features two procedurally generated
        backgrounds: a fishing dock and an aquarium where players can view their
        catches. Caught fish are saved to local storage, and players can
        interact by clicking to catch fish and hovering to view them. Our main
        focus is on creating a diverse and visually interesting fish generator
        with a cohesive pixel aesthetic.

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        When hovering over a fish, their information is displayed inside of the
        game. All of the player’s caught fish is displayed to the side. When the
        game is reloaded, fish saved to local storage are loaded back into the
        game. Each fish has a unique movement speed/pattern and behavior.
        Aggressive fish will chase other fish who are a different color to them
        and eat them, creating emergent behavior. Fish rarity is calculated
        based on the fish’s color, texture, and pattern. Monochrome fish are
        less rare, while special patterns like stripes, rainbow fish, or analog
        horror fish are more rare.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I worked on creating the fish generator, the fish drawing functions for
        the aquarium, the fish ui (hover and side display), and helped with
        refactoring the code and fixing bugs. For the fish generator I looked at
        several fish generators online for reference –
        https://github.com/igruenig/fishGenerator?tab=readme-ov-file and
        https://fishdraw.glitch.me/ by Lingdong Huang. I also researched
        pixelization and color quantization to experiment with different fish
        styles and patterns. Overall I’m very happy with the progress we have
        made as a team and grateful to be working on this project together.
        There are still a lot of ideas that we haven’t managed to implement such
        as genetic evolution, saving fish images, more varied text generation
        that depends on the fish, gamified fishing, so in the future I might add
        additional features.
