            The stems were drawn using lines drawn recursively with perlin
            noise. The leaf shape is credited to pphoebelemonn at
            https://editor.p5js.org/pphoebelemonn/sketches/9k-zBl-NF. I applied
            a gradient onto the leaf colors and sizes so that it looked like the
            leafs are getting smaller and lighter in color the more to the
            right. The shadows are the vectors drawn a second time, with the
            shadow colors taken from the base color and made darker. To make the
            tangled look, I drew multiple vines growing from slightly offset
            origin points from the left so that the vines and leafs could
            overlap.

            This was a very exciting and fun project to work on. I learned a lot
            about how to manipulate graphics using various equations, and how to
            use perlin noise to generate content. The part I feel like was the
            most successful was how the leaves turned out. My favorite part is
            how the leaves have some randomized color and are drawn overlapping
            the roots, so that when it clumps up it looks like itâ€™s 3D, which is
            pretty cool. <br /><br />The most challenging part of this project
            was figuring out how to make the roots look like roots. I thought
            that using recursion would be the best way, but it was really hard
            to figure out how, since originally the points were first rendered
            where every frame would go and calculate the next point and then
            draw it. To solve this problem, I had to rewrite the root class to
            first draw and store its points into an array and then draw those
            points instead. But then later on I ran into other issues like the
            branches being offset by the noise and that took a long time to
            figure out why.<br /><br />
            If I had more time to work on this project, I would try to make the
            roots animated too. Originally I wanted to animate the roots slowly
            growing and branching out but ran out of time to do it. I would also
            like to add ways to interact with the canvas, like growing roots
            from the mouse position instead of a fixed point.
