            The stems were drawn using lines drawn recursively with perlin
            noise. The leaf shape is credited to pphoebelemonn at
            https://editor.p5js.org/pphoebelemonn/sketches/9k-zBl-NF. I applied
            a gradient onto the leaf colors and sizes so that it looked like the
            leafs are getting smaller and lighter in color the more to the
            right. The shadows are the vectors drawn a second time, with the
            shadow colors taken from the base color and made darker. To make the
            tangled look, I drew multiple vines growing from slightly offset
            origin points from the left so that the vines and leafs could
            overlap.

            This was a very exciting and fun project to work on. I learned a lot
            about how to manipulate graphics using various equations, and how to
            use perlin noise to generate content.
